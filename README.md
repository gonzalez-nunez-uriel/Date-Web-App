# Simple-Angular-Nest-App
This is a simple Web App that uses an Angular front-end and a NestJS backend. The back-end returns a JSON with today's date and the front-end requests it and renders it. It is an exercise of connecting the front-end with the back-end.

# Basic Setup
For this project, I created two independent directories: a frontend and a backend. Each work independently of each other and must be hosted separately. This is only for development. For deployment I was going to put all the transpiled files of the Angular project as static assets in the NestJS server and have them sent for GET /. I did not reach that point yet. The website has a lot of issues.

# To work with this project
You need to install Angular and NestJS, which is straightforward with npm. Once you do that, you should be able to work with these files as they are, without any issues.
